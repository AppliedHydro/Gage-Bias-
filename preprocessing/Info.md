This directory contains files used for the preprocessing of the various datasets in the project. GRADES, HydroATLAS, Streamflow Catalog, and Esri shapefiles were 
all used in the construction of the final dataset that contains GRADES segment numbers, Gage locations (spatially joined to GRADES segments),
HydroATLAS variables (spatially joined to GRADES segments). <br/>
There are additional files used to check for any duplicate values, gage assignments to multiple river segments, and filtering the streamflow catalog based on 
status of gage (active/inactive), location of gage (by state, county, etc.), or by organizational ownership.
